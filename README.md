# üîê Automated Security Scanning within DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline

A GitHub Actions-powered CI/CD pipeline for **automated application security scanning** and **containerised deployments** with real-time vulnerability reporting. This project integrates multiple security layers‚ÄîSAST, DAST, dependency scanning, container scanning, secret detection, and notification delivery‚Äîto ensure production-grade security from development to deployment.

> ‚öôÔ∏è Developed with the support of [Harsh Chauhan](https://github.com/Harsh2509), who contributed significantly to the application development phase of the project.

# üíª Application Development Architecture

This project is a full-stack web application developed with **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **React.js**. The front end was crafted to serve a responsive and user-friendly interface. Key features of the application include dynamic data rendering, RESTful API integration, and reusable component structures.

The project is a full-stack course-selling web Application, divided into two main components: a Frontend (Client) and a Backend (Server)‚Äîboth containerised and orchestrated via Docker.

## üß† Backend: `./server` Directory
The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB (via Mongoose). It implements a RESTful API for admin and user operations, and uses JWT-based authentication middleware.

**‚úÖ Core Components:**
- `index.js`
  Acts as the application entry point. It sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB using mongoose, initializes middlewares, and mounts both user and admin routes.

- Authentication Middlewares
  - `adminAuth.js`: Verifies admin JWT tokens to protect admin routes.
  - `userAuth.js`: Verifies user JWT tokens for accessing user features like course purchase and access.

- Route Handlers
  - `routes/admin.js`:
     Handles admin functionalities including:
      - Admin signup/login
      - Create, update, and delete courses
      - View all or specific courses

  - `routes/users.js`:
     Handles user functionalities including:
      - User signup/login
      - Browse available courses
      - Purchase and view purchased courses

  - Environment Configurations
    - `.env`: Stores sensitive credentials like the JWT secret (`DB_KEY`) and MongoDB connection URI (`DB_URL`), injected securely in GitHub Actions.

  - Dockerfile
    Containerises the backend service. It copies the code, installs dependencies, and exposes the application on a specified port.

# üß¨ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This pipeline includes five key stages with integrated security and build processes:

## üõ°Ô∏è `security-scan`
**Objective:** Run comprehensive static security scans and prepare development artifacts.

- **Node Setup:** Installs Node.js 24.0.2 for compatibility with tools like Snyk.
- **NPM Install:** Installs dependencies in both root and `server` directories.
- **CodeQL:** Performs static application security testing (SAST) for JavaScript using GitHub Code Scanning.
- **Snyk:** Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies (`package.json`) and generates SARIF reports.
- **Gitleaks:** Scans for hardcoded secrets in source files.
- **Hadolint:** Ensures Dockerfile adheres to best practices.
- **Dockle:** Analyses Docker image configurations for security hardening.
- **Trivy:** Performs vulnerability scanning on the Docker image, reporting CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs.
- **Artifact Uploads:** All SARIF and scan reports are uploaded for GitHub security insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è `build`
**Objective:** Build the application stack using Docker Compose.

- **Secrets Injection:** Securely injects DB credentials into `.env` files.
- **Compose Build:** Builds multi-container services from `docker-compose.yml`.

## üì¶ `dockerhub-push`
**Objective:** Create and push versioned Docker images.

- **Docker Login:** Authenticates with DockerHub using secrets.
- **Image Tagging:** Tags the image using both `latest` and Git short SHA.
- **Push:** Publishes both image tags to DockerHub.

## üî• `zap-scan`
**Objective:** Perform DAST scanning using OWASP ZAP.

- **Start Frontend:** Spins up the client service using Docker Compose.
- **Wait for Readiness:** Ensures the frontend is accessible before scanning.
- **Permissions Fix:** Sets workspace permissions to allow ZAP file writes.
- **ZAP Scan:** Runs `zap-baseline.py` on the frontend endpoint.
- **Report Upload:** Uploads HTML, JSON, and Markdown reports.
- **Issue Creation:** Automatically opens GitHub issues on vulnerabilities found.

## üîî `slack-alert`
**Objective:** Send real-time Slack alerts based on scan results.

- **Status Check:** Evaluates the conclusion of `security-scan` and `zap-scan` jobs.
- **Report Parsing:** Analyses ESLint and ZAP outputs to count and categorise issues.
- **Slack Notify:** Posts a detailed summary including:
  - ESLint Issues
  - ZAP Vulnerabilities (by severity)
  - Direct GitHub Actions run link
