# üîê Automated Security Scanning within DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline

A GitHub Actions-powered CI/CD pipeline for **automated application security scanning** and **containerised deployments** with real-time vulnerability reporting. This project integrates multiple security layers‚ÄîSAST, DAST, dependency scanning, container scanning, secret detection, and notification delivery‚Äîto ensure production-grade security from development to deployment.

> ‚öôÔ∏è Developed with the support of [Harsh Chauhan](https://github.com/Harsh2509), who contributed significantly to the application development phase of the project.

# üß¨ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This pipeline includes five key stages:

## üõ°Ô∏è `security-scan`
**Objective:** Secure code and containers before deployment.

- **CodeQL SAST** for JavaScript vulnerabilities
- **Snyk scan** for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Gitleaks** for secret detection
- **Hadolint** for Dockerfile best practices
- **Dockle** for container hardening
- **Trivy** for image CVE scanning
- Uploads reports to GitHub Security and artifacts

## üõ†Ô∏è `build`
**Objective:** Build Docker images with `docker-compose`.

- Injects secrets
- Runs `docker-compose build`

## üì¶ `dockerhub-push`
**Objective:** Push versioned images.

- Builds and tags images with `latest` and `commit-sha`
- Pushes to DockerHub

## üî• `zap-scan`
**Objective:** DAST scan with OWASP ZAP.

- Starts frontend service
- Waits for readiness
- Runs ZAP scan on `http://localhost:8080`
- Uploads reports and creates GitHub issues

## üîî `slack-alert`
**Objective:** Notifications based on results.

- Evaluates job statuses
- Summarises ESLint and ZAP alerts
- Sends a formatted alert message to the Slack channel
